# Book-Sphere

A platform website for selling and buying books from multiple vendors, which accepts online payments and cash on delivery.

This platform is a full-stack MERN app built with:

- `MongoDB`, which is a flexible, fast, and easy database.
- `Express.js`, which is a handy Node.js framework for handling HTTP traffic.
- `React.js`, a popular library for building the front-end.
- `Node.js`, which is a powerful runtime environment for developing server-side apps with TypeScript.
- `Tailwind CSS` is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to quickly create custom designs without writing custom styles by using pre-defined classes.

### üîê Seller Authentication

### üîê User Authentication
